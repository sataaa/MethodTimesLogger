# MethodTimesLogger

A simple project with an aspect (com.phantomrod.aspect.PhantomRodLogger) that logs every method call inside a specific package (com.phantomrod.*)

Just run Main.java and check the output. Note that there is no logging being done in Looper and only once in Main. The aspect is the one actually doing all the logging.
